# MasterAni_LinkGrabber

I'm running this script on a Raspberry Pi 3.

First you have to install [BeautifulSoup4](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/#Download), then you have to download [Dryscrape](https://dryscrape.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) and install it. 

Then you can run the grabber.py script

```
python grabber.py URL STARTEPISODE ENDEPISODE HOST
```

#### Hosts

+ google
+ Vidstreaming
+ mp4

You can now paste the Textfile created into JDownloader or any Download Manager you want.
